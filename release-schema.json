The URI should include a fragment identifier with the `name` value of a particular resource within that file in order to identify the particular budget or spending data file to which contract level budget allocations and spending measures can be compared, and the particular column definitions to use. The referenced resource should contain `field` or `extraField` properties with their `name` property matching each of the budget/financial progress breakdown `classification` or `measure` fields in the OCDS data, and at minimum providing labels for these.",
